<h2>About Me</h2>

<p>Hi. My name is Duncan Collins. I'm 19 years old. I'm a sophmore at Coastal Carolina University. My major is Digital Culture and Design. I'm currently doing designs and logos for people to boost my resume. I have designed a hat a 2 shirts for a company called Carolina Brown Apparel. I did the logo at our church and a couple other small projects. I live in Conway, South Carolina. My hobbies include playing xbox, hanging out with friends, and watching sports. I love the Green Bay Packers. I lived in Wisconsin for 3 years and while I lived there, the Packers won the Super Bowl.  I've been a fan ever since. In September of last year, Make-A-Wish granted my wish and I got to meet the Green Bay Packers. My family and I got a tour of the stadium, walked through their Hall Of Fame Museum, went to a practice, met the players and coaches and go to the game the next day. I even got to eat lunch with Aaron Rodgers<span>&#128102;&#127995;</span>. It was an amazing experience!</p>
